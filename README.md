## **I.INTRODUCTION**
In this project, a _**operation dashboard**_ was developed using _**Design Thinking**_ approach and _**Power BI**_ tools (**_DAX_**, **_Power Query_**, and **_Visualization_** tools) to analyze **_global sales performance_** over 4 years. The dashboard aimed to assist senior managers in **_understanding business performance by region, product, and sales personnel,_** which led to **_decisions_** in **_Market expansion_**, **_Market optimization_**, and **_Product selection_**.

### **1. BUSINESS QUESTIONS**

## **IV. INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1 Overall Purchasing Performance**

- **Average order processing time is 19.45 days**, which is relatively long and may affect supply chain efficiency.
- **On-time delivery rate is 100%**, indicating an effective purchasing process in terms of delivery timeliness.
- **Total shipping cost is $1.58M**, accounting for **2.25% of the total invoice value ($70.48M)**. Specifically:
    - **Cargo Transport 5** has the highest shipping cost **($0.73M)**, nearly double that of **ZY-Express ($0.34M)** and three times that of **Overnight J-Fast ($0.27M)**.
    - There are significant cost differences among shipping providers, which may impact overall purchasing expenses.

✅ **Reduce order processing time  to ~15 days** by:

- Implementing **long-term contracts** with reliable suppliers to reduce negotiation time.
- Using **purchase automation** to speed up approval and order processing.
- Integrating **inventory management systems** to forecast demand and enable proactive ordering.

✅ **Review Cargo Transport 5’s contract and consider alternatives**:

- Compare costs among shipping providers and explore **lower-cost alternatives**.
- **Negotiate discounts** with Cargo Transport 5 if their shipping volume remains high.

**2 Order Analysis by Year**

- **Total purchasing spending increased significantly from 2011 to 2014**, peaking in 2014.
- **The fastest growth occurred between 2012 and 2013**, reflecting an expanding purchasing demand.

**3 Product Rejection Rate Analysis**

- **Average rejection rate: 3.1%** across a total of **2.32 million units received**.
- Some products have **high rejection rates**:
    - **Metal Sheet 1 (10.3%)**, **Paint - Black (8.7%)**, **Flat Washer 1 (8.5%)**.
    - These products may have quality issues from suppliers or errors in inbound inspections.
- High-volume items like **ML Crankarm (43,784 units received)** also show significant rejections **(2,805 units)**, which could impact production.

✅ **Improve quality control for incoming goods:**

- **Enhance inspection** for high-rejection products.
- Collaborate with suppliers to **improve manufacturing processes** and minimize defects.
- **Develop a reliable supplier list**, eliminating vendors with consistently high rejection rates.

**4 Vendor Analysis**

- **Total vendors: 104**, with **100 active** and **4 inactive**.
- **93 vendors are preferred**, but **11 vendors are not**, suggesting potential optimization opportunities.
- **Superior Bicycles** is the largest vendor by purchase value **($4.55M)**, followed by **Professional Athletic Consultants ($3.06M)**.
- Some vendors have higher rejection rates, which may be linked to price or product quality issues.

✅ **Remove inefficient vendors:**

- Phase out or reduce reliance on **non-preferred vendors (11 vendors)**, focusing on suppliers with better quality and pricing.
- **Negotiate long-term contracts** with vendors achieving **100% on-time delivery**.


**5 Standard Price vs. Last Purchase Price Analysis**

- **A 5% discrepancy** exists between standard and actual purchase prices.
- Some products have higher purchase costs than standard prices, potentially increasing overall expenses if not managed properly.

✅ **Minimize price fluctuations**:

- Establish **price ceilings** for each product based on historical data.
- **Negotiate stable long-term pricing** with suppliers.
- Regularly monitor the difference between standard and actual purchase prices to **prevent unnecessary cost increases**.
